        <p> Hi there! My name is Sophie Jahn üëã </p>
        <p> You might know me from <em>Nattryttarna</em> or as the author of <em>Pappas flicka p√• H√§stg√§rden</em>, but my personal journey with food began long before that. I grew up with a complicated relationship to eating. Food was tied to shame, guilt, control. I spent years chasing the ‚Äúperfect diet‚Äù, believing health was about restriction and willpower.</p>
        <p> But as I began to heal, I learned something different.</p>
        <p> When we nourish ourselves with natural, clean foods, everything changes. Brain fog lifts. Energy returns. Anxiety fades. We feel good. Not just physically, but emotionally. And this is where naima began. In my kitchen, with a simple mission.</p>
        <p> To help people feel better through the food they eat. Naima was born from a need to feel better.</p>
        <p>Walk into any grocery store and try to find a snack without a long processed ingredient list. We couldn‚Äôt. And we looked everywhere.</p>
        <p> Most products today are full of fillers, additives, refined sugars, and seed oils. </p>
        <p> Things that science now shows can wear down our bodies and minds. Poor nutrition is linked to anxiety, depression and inflammation. And yet, the foods we reach for every day still haven‚Äôt caught up with this knowledge.</p>
        <p><strong> Naima is here to change that at all costs for us that want better! </strong></p>
      </StyledBody>
